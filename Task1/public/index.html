                <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions:</h2>
                <h3>Step 1: Gather Materials</h3>
                <p>Collect wooden planks or logs that are strong and sturdy. You can use fallen trees or driftwood. Make sure the wood is dry and free from rot.</p>

                <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Wood</h3>
                <p>Cut the wood into manageable lengths. You will need long pieces for the base of the boat and shorter pieces for the sides and supports.</p>

                <h3>Step 3: Build the Frame</h3>
                <p>Lay out the long pieces of wood parallel to each other, spaced evenly apart. These will form the base of your boat. Use the shorter pieces to create cross supports, nailing them securely in place.</p>

                <h3>Step 4: Construct the Sides</h3>
                <p>Attach additional pieces of wood along the sides of the base to create the sides of the boat. Make sure they are firmly secured with nails or rope.</p>

                <h3>Step 5: Waterproof the Boat</h3>
                <p>Cover the bottom and sides of the boat with waterproof tarpaulin or large leaves to prevent water from seeping in. Secure the covering with nails or by tying it down with rope.</p>

                <h3>Step 6: Final Touches</h3>
                <p>Double-check all the connections to ensure the boat is sturdy. Attach a paddle or pole for steering and you're ready to set sail!</p>
